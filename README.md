# Crime Classification using Machine Learning 🕵️‍♂️📊
### Project by: Navya Tyagi
### Grade: S (Highest) / 90 Score 🏆
## Project Description 📚
This project focuses on crime classification using a variety of machine-learning algorithms. The dataset used is from a Kaggle competition, and the goal is to predict the type of crime based on given features such as crime location, time, and other relevant factors.

Several machine learning models were implemented to tackle this classification task, including:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier
6. XGBoost Classifier
7. Decision Tree Classifier
8. MLP Classifier (Neural Network)
   
The project involved cleaning and pre-processing the data, implementing various models, and evaluating their performance. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and consists of several features such as:

1. Numerical Features: (e.g., latitude, longitude)
2. Categorical Features: (e.g., crime location, time of crime)
3. Target Variable: Type of crime
   
The dataset also had some missing values and special characters ('?') which were appropriately handled.

## Results and Model Performance 📈
After thorough evaluation and tuning, the Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier gave the highest performance metrics. The models were evaluated based on accuracy scores.
